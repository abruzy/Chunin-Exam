<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

There are several services and some platforms providing URL shortener. Sometimes they call it link shortener, URL shrinker, Link compressor, vanity URL creator, but they all work the same:

- You enter a URL and the output is a short URL.
- You can use that short URL for example for social media sharing.
- When users click on the short link they are getting redirected to your origin URL.

Some services provide a Custom URL shortener, so that you can register your domain and use that domain to shrink your URLs. Using your domain can create more trust for the ones who see the link.

### Built With

This progam was made using this technologies

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
- [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

  You can easily install Ruby on your Linux computer by using [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/) and [Chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby)

```sh
brew install chruby
brew install ruby-install
ruby-install ruby
```

- Rails
  You can easily install Rails by using [the odin project's giude](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/your-facebook-clonelication) or directly from the [rails site](https://rubyonrails.org/)

```sh
  gem install rails

<!-- 1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com) -->

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone git@github.com:abruzy/Chunin-Exam.git
```

2. The next thing is to change directory folder

```sh
cd Chunin-Exam
```

3. The next step is to install all the dependencies by running the following command below

```sh
bundle install
```

```sh

4. create a file called '.env' in your root directory and copy the field below and paste it inside that .env file

```sh
DATABASE_NAME='yourdatabasename'

DATABASE_PASSWORD='yourpassword'
DATABASE_HOST='yourpostgreshost'
DATABASE_PORT='yourportnumber'
```

5. The next step is to run the command below

```sh
rails db:create
```

6. The next step is to migrate to our database by running the following command

```

7. Voila!!, you did a great job but alas, we need to complete the whole step by actually starting our server by running the command below
